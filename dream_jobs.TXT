Hi, this is Darren Zhang. 
I'm uncertain as to what my dream job is. 
As of now, I am aiming to become a software engineer.
I plan on obtaining a master's degree and maybe even a phd. 
I'm interested in doing research in machine learning in the future.


Hi This is Sophia! 
My dream job would mostly likely be  a perfect marriage between travel and tech. 
Perhaps I can roam the world testing cool tech and gadgets.
